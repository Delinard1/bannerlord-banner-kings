	        text="{=!}Books can be found through specialized sellers that can be found in town keeps throughout the continent. They do not stay in the same place for long. Books are written in a specific {BK_LANGUAGES_LINK} and are associated with a {CHARACTER_LINK} skill. Your ability to understand the language will determine how quickly you can read the book. You can acquire a copy of Dictionarium Calradium to be able to read any book, although in very slow manner. Books can be either Skill books or Focus books, mostly the latter. Skill books provide a big amount of experience in their associated skill. Focus books provide less skill, but provide a focus point in that skill. If the skill's focus is already maxed out, the point is instead transformed into more skill experience." />
