Banner Kings is a suite of features developed for Mount & Blade: Bannerlord. The modification focuses on adding depth to gameplay. This is done by expanding and adding layers of complexity to non-combat related features of the game. Inspiration for the mod systems is mostly drawn from games such as Crusader Kings.
